## Appendix

From this project we can learn which things affect the house price more and in some areas some facility will be not there because of some reasons. we can identify the hidden information through insights.
## Libraries Used
    python 3.9.7
    pandas 1.3.4
    numpy 1.20.3
    seaborn 0.11.2

## Lessons Learned
 I used three different algorithams to predict this model accuracy.

 EDA was the major thing for this project.

 Accuracy of a model depends upon how we clean the raw data to how we use the features.
